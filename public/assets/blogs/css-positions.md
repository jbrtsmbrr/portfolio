In this post I'll explain the behavior of each individual position type in css:
  - Static
  - Relative
  - Absolute
  - Fixed


#### Okay, let's start!

First let's create a file called `position.html` and paste the code below in it, and open the file in a browser.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Positions</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
        padding: 100px;
      }

      .grand-parent {
        position: static;
        top: 500px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="grand-parent">
      <div class="parent">
        The company itself is a very successful company. I follow from being the pleasure of those who, because the very thing is the pleasure of obtaining, no one will accept the consequences of <span class="child">flexibility</span>, we lead the times, it takes exercise and it is easy to give birth!
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

1. **Static Position**
  - Okay, let's talk about the position type that you always used, it is the position `static`.
  - If you add directional properties (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) in an element that is positioned static, you'll notice that those properties will not work. It is because `static` position type, position itself in the natural flow of elements.
  - And also, the reason I say that you'll use `static` position
the most is because it is the default position of every 
html element.

  Let's try adding static position and directional property in `grand-parent` class

  ```html
    <head>
      // meta data ...
      <title>CSS Positions</title>
      <style>
        body {...}

        .grand-parent {
          position: static;
          top: 500px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      ...
    </body>
  ```

  Now if we refresh the browser, nothings really happen! But as soon as you change the position type to (let say, position `relative`)
  you'll see that the directional property starts to work as expected.

  With that said, let's take a look at the position `relative`

2. **Relative Position**
  - So, `relative` is another positioning statement that you'll use quite often.
  - In relative position we have to really be aware of where things currently are and how they flow together.

  Ok, to give you an example let's apply `relative` position and directional properties in the class called `child`.

  ```html
    <head>
      // meta data ...
      <title>CSS Positions</title>
      <style>
        body {...}

        .child {
          position: relative;
          top: 80px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      ...
    </body>
  ```

  - When you refresh the page, one thing you'll notice is the directional properties starts working as expected.
  - Next, if you look carefully, you'll see that the natural flow of the other html elements are still respecting the area of .child class

3. **Absolute Position**
  - To start, let's declare an absolute position in `child` class.

    ```html
      <head>
        // meta data ...
        <title>CSS Positions</title>
        <style>
          body {...}

          .child {
            position: absolute;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        ...
      </body>
    ```
  - You'll notice that the other html elements doesn't respect the area of `child` class anymore, that is because
    when you absolutely position an element the effect of it(in terms of area/dimension) are removed outside of the DOM
    and the elements around it flows as if it wasn't there.
    
    ![assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig2](/assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig2.PNG)
  
  - We still don't apply any directional property yet, so by default its `auto`. But let's try adding `top` property to the `child` class element, and see what will happen.

    ```html
      <head>
        // meta data ...
        <title>CSS Positions</title>
        <style>
          body {...}

          .child {
            position: absolute;
            background: lime;
            top: 0;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        ...
      </body>
    ```
    > I also added background color so we can easily see where the `.child` element is.

  ![assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig3](/assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig3.PNG)

  - Notice that the `.child` element jumps all the way to the top of the window. 
  - Now why is it? It is because when you declare an `absolute` position to an element, *it will be positioned relative to its nearest parent with a declared position*. If you don't have one, it will be positioned relative to document, that's why when we declare a `top` property to `.child` element it jumps to the top of the window.
  - Just to test that statement let's now add a position statement to the `.grand-parent` element.

    ```html
      <head>
        // meta data ...
        <title>CSS Positions</title>
        <style>
          body {...}

          .child {...}
          
          .grand-parent {
            position: relative;
            background: lightgray;
            padding: 20px;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        ...
      </body>
    ```

    ![assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig4](/assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig4.PNG)

    > I also added `background-color` and `padding` to the `.grand-parent` element so we can easily its dimension.

  - Notice that as soon as we add a `position: relative;` to the `.grand-parent` element, the `.child` element position itself relative to it because it is the nearest parent we a declared position statement.

4. **Fixed Position**
  - Before we jump into the `fixed` position, let's update our html file first.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>CSS Positions</title>
        <style>
          body {
            font-family: sans-serif;
            padding: 100px;
          }

          .child {
            position: fixed;
            background: lime;
          }

          .grand-parent {
            position: relative;
            background: lightgray;
            padding: 20px;
          }

          .tall-container {
            height: 100vh;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class="grand-parent">
          <div class="parent">
            The company itself is a very successful company. I follow from being the pleasure of those who, because the very thing is the pleasure of obtaining, no one will accept the consequences of <span class="child">flexibility</span>, we lead the times, it takes exercise and it is easy to give birth!
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tall-container"></div>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    > What we did here is we added another element with a class `tall-container` and make it very tall so that we can scroll the page.

  - Now that we updated the file, let's talk about the `fixed` position.
  - Just like `absolute` positioning, `fixed` position causes the other html elements around it to flows as if it wasn't there.
  - Now, notice that we have `.grand-parent` that still positioned `relative`, so if `fixed` position have really similar rule as `absolute` position, if we declare `top: 0` statement to the `.child` element, then, it will positioned itself at the top of `.grand-parent` element.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        // meta tags...
        <title>CSS Positions</title>
        <style>
          body {...}

          .child {
            position: fixed;
            background: lime;
            top: 0;
          }

          .grand-parent {
            position: relative;
            background: lightgray;
            padding: 20px;
          }

          .tall-container {...}
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>...</body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    ![assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig3](/assets/blogs/images/css-positions/blog-positioning-fig3.PNG)

    - Notice that it jumps at the top of the page, it is because, `fixed` position always position itself relative to the document window.
    - Now because of that we can just scroll and all the `fixed` positioned elements sticks where you positioned it.



That's it! I hope you learned something üëèü•≥
